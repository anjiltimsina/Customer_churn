# Customer_churn
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning models. Churn prediction is a crucial task for businesses, particularly in industries like telecommunications, banking, and subscription services, as it helps identify customers who are likely to leave, allowing companies to take proactive steps to retain them.

In this project, we use  customer data, including various features to build a predictive model that classifies customers as likely to churn or stay. The goal is to identify patterns in customer behavior and improve retention strategies through data-driven insights.

# Features
- Manual Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and ensured data consistency.
- Data Visualization: Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize and explore the data.
- Pipeline: Implemented a machine learning pipeline for streamlined preprocessing and model training.
- Modeling: Trained and compared several models.
  > Logistic Regression
  > XGBoost
  > Random Forest
  > Decision Tree
  > SVM

- Model Selection: Evaluated models and selected the one with the best accuracy for churn prediction.
